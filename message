Hello rider support,

I have issues when trying to reference my own analzyers in rider. 
It either seems to fail silently or there are assembly not found errors.
Works all on linux (tested ubuntu focal).


I have reproduced this in a simple setup on [this github repo](https://github.com/rtnlmeme-DestroyerOfDeath/rider-analyzer-assembly-resolve) .

1) clone repo
2) open the project "analzyer-target" in rider
3) enable roslyn analzyers

Expected (and happens on linux):
- Analzyer shows up in "Roslyn Settings",
- Class declaration shows diagnostic

Actual:
-> "EmptyAnalyzer" shows up in the solution explorer, 
but not in the "Roslyn Settings" and there is no further feedback on failure.
Class declaration doesn't show diagnostic.


More info:

- This also happens when we make a 'pulish' build of the analyzer with rider.

- Maybe related:

This is the output when I build the target project with visual studio:
```
1>------ Build started: Project: analyzer-target, Configuration: Debug Any CPU ------
1>CSC : warning CS8032: An instance of analyzer EmptyAnalyzer.BestAnalyzer cannot be created from C:\Users\USER\repos\rider-analyzer-assembly-resolve\empty-analyzer\EmptyAnalyzer\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\EmptyAnalyzer.dll : Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.CodeAnalysis, Version=3.6.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified..

1>Done building project "analyzer-target.csproj".
========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========
```


Second issue I have:

0) In the test repo
1)  change analyzer-target.csproj to reference the the "RoslynTools" Analzyers,

this is closer to the project structure I have for my actual analzyer project. It shows this error in rider:


```
The following issues were encountered while loading projects for Roslyn analyzers.
            These issues affect only Roslyn analyzers and will not affect code analysis provided by Rider itself.
In project analyzer-target: All analyzers from assembly Analyzers failed to load: Unable to load one or more of the requested types. Retrieve the LoaderExceptions property for more information. Could not load file or assembly 'System.Runtime, Version=4.2.2.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
```

More info:

- In my actual project, I get an additional warning of the same kind about "System.Collection.Generic".


Thanks a lot for you help in advance!
